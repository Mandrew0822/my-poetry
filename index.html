Hallowed husks, who don't own their cold, decaying breath,
They are only marionettes who live solely for the entity they call master,
There exists no soul, no thoughts, and no will not ordained by the grandmaster,
Through mist and mud they're made to obey,
Each step prescribed like all the rest.
Their armor gleams but hearts are carved from alabaster,
Two kingdoms wage their games with lives cast faster,
No glory found where shadows lay,
Like rusted horns bereft of breath,
Each swings their blade, as strings command them faster.">

Mountains soar to tear the sky,
Oceans roar, and yet are confined,
In nature's art, the heart's reply.
Sunrise spills in a blossoming rose,
Sunset's blaze, like molten gold,
Every leaf and creature flows,
In the tapestry of life, his love is told.
Seasons waltz in cosmic dance,
Morning mist and twilight's veil,
Hints of a divine romance,
In every moment, a second chance.
In each breath, a world unfurled,
With each detail pearled,
Whispers of a love so vast,
Echoes of eternity, forever cast.">
